# Weather-Forecast-Page
## Description
Here, i was tasked with creating a weather forecast page to consolidate my knowledge of APIs and storage . I had to use local sotorage alngside jquery to create history of searches which functioned as buttons to start a new search. I used CSS to style this . Any search be it in the bar or via button ,will return a 5 day weather forecast which uses day js to format the dates and the actual data is from Open Weather. This helped me learn how to read API files as i had to use images from the site which i was unfamiliar with. I also added a function so that only searcges that didnt match previous seraches would save in history (so multiples of the same city were not saved)
